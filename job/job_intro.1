job_intro \- quick introduction to the jobserver

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The jobserver is a centralised system that allows long-running or regularly
scheduled jobs to be started easily, and restarted when the system reboots, or
if they crash.  This document provides a quick introduction to using the
jobserver.  For a full description of all the jobserver's features, see
\fBjob\fR(1).

.SH ADDING A JOB

.LP
The user interface to the jobserver is the \fBjob\fR(1) command, which is used
to create, manage and delete jobs.  To create a new job, use the \fBjob add\fR
command:

.in +2
.nf
example% job add -e $HOME/myjob.sh
New job FMRI is job:/jsmith/myjob_sh.
.fi
.in -2

.LP
This creates a new job called \fBmyjob.sh\fR and uses \fB$HOME/myjob.sh\fR as
the start command.  The \fB-e\fR option causes the job to be automatically
enabled and started.  To view the status of the job, use \fBjob list\fR:

.in +2
.nf
example% job list
STATE    RSTATE   FMRI
enabled  running  job:/jsmith/myjob_sh
.fi
.in -2

.LP
The job FMRI (Fault Management Resource Identifier), in this case
\fBjob:/jsmith/myjob_sh\fR, is used to uniquely identify the job.  You will
need to use the FMRI whenever you interact with the jobserver.  The FMRI
can be abbreviated to the smallest part, so \fBjob:/jsmith/myjob_sh\fR could
also be written as just \fBmyjob_sh\fR.

.LP
To stop a running job, use the \fBjob disable\fR \fIfmri\fR command.  The
jobserver will send \fBSIGTERM\fR to all processes in the job, wait 30 seconds,
then send \fBSIGKILL\fR to any remaining processes.  To delete a job
entirely, use \fBjob delete\fR \fIfmri\fR.

.SH VIEWING JOB OUTPUT

.LP
Any output from the job will be sent to the file
\fB$HOME/.job/job_\fR\fIname\fR\fB.log\fR, which will be rotated automatically
once it reaches 1MB in size.  \fIname\fR is constructed by taking the job's FMRI,
removing the initial \fBjob:/\fR\fIusername\fR\fB/\fB, and replacing all '/'
characters with '_' in the remainder.

.SH SCHEDULED JOBS

.LP
Instead of starting the job immediately, you can schedule a job to run at a
particular time:

.in +2
.nf
example% job add -S "every monday at 03:00" $HOME/myjob.sh
New job FMRI is job:/jsmith/myjob_sh.
example% job list
STATE      RSTATE   FMRI
scheduled  stopped  job:/jsmith/myjob_sh
.fi
.in -2

.LP
The jobserver will start the scheduled job at the given time.  Note that since
the schedule specification contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes to
protect it from the shell.  See \fBjob_schedule\fR(1) for a list of valid
schedule specifications.

.LP
Instead of using \fB-S\fR, you can schedule an existing job with the \fBjob
schedule\fR command:

.in +2
.nf
example% job schedule myjob_sh "every minute"
.fi
.in -2

.LP
To force a scheduled job to start before it normally would be, use the \fBjob
start\fR \fIfmri\fR command.

.SH MAINTENANCE STATE
.LP
If a job fails, it will be placed in the \fBmaintenance\fR state:

.in +2
.nf
example% job list
STATE        RSTATE   FMRI
maintenance  stopped  job:/jsmith/myjob_sh
.fi
.in -2

.LP
A job in this state will never be started by the jobserver.  To restart the
job, fix whatever problem caused the job to fail, then clear the maintenance
state with \fBjob clear \fR\fIfmri\fR.  

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.LP
The jobserver sets some standard environment variables when starting a job:
\fBHOME\fR, \fBLOGNAME\fR, \fBUSER\fR, \fBSHELL\fR, and \fBPATH\fR.  To set
additional environment variables, create a file called \fB$HOME/.environment\fR
and write \fINAME\fR\fB=\fR\fIVALUE\fR pairs in it, one per line.

.SH RESOURCE LIMITS

.LP
Resource limits are a way to restrict the resources a job can use, so that
a broken job doesn't adversely affect the rest of the system.  Use the
\fBjob limit\fR command to set resource limits.  For example, to limit the
process to 10MB of memory:

.in +2
.nf
example% job limit myjob_sh max-data-size=10240
.fi
.in -2

.LP
To view a job's resource limits, use \fBjob limit\fR \fIfmri\fR.  See
\fBjob_limit\fR(1) for a list of available resource limits.
