.SH EXIT ACTIONS

.LP
When a job exits, its exit action is invoked.  There are three separate exit
actions: \fBexit\fR, which is used when the job exits with return code 0,
\fBfail\fR, which is used when the job exits with a non-zero return code,
and \fBcrash\fR, which is used when a process in the job receives a fatal
signal.

.LP
The exit action describes what the jobserver should do when the exit event
occurs.  The default for all actions is \fBdisable,mail\fR, which means the
job will be disabled, and mail will be sent to the job's owner.  Valid actions
are \fBdisable\fR and \fBrestart\fR, which causes the job to restart.  The
\fBmail\fR modifier can be used with either action.
