This is the jobserver, a flexible replacement for 'cron' and 'at'.  The
jobserver allows users to define scheduled and continuously-running jobs, and
takes care of starting and stopping them as appropriate.  It provides a similar
facility as SMF, but works for any user, not just root.

The jobserver is written and tested on Solaris 10, but it should also work on
OpenSolaris.  It will not work on any other operating systems.

The Sun Studio compiler is required to build.  It is tested with 12u1, but
should work with other versions.

To build and install:

 $ make
 $ su
 # make install
 # svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/system/jobserver.xml
 # svccfg enable jobserver

The jobserver will take care of creating its own database in /var/jobserver,
and no configuration is required to use it.

The jobserver users RBAC for authorisation.  Any user with the
"solaris.jobs.user" authorisation will be allowed to use the jobserver.  (This
is granted to all users by default.)  Any user with the "solaris.jobs.admin"
authorisation (including Primary Administrators) will have administratior
access.

If you're running Solaris 10, you need to edit /etc/security/prof_attr to
replace "solaris.jobs.users" with "solaris.jobs.user", otherwise only
administrators will be able to use the jobserver.  (This is Sun bug 6337435,
and is fixed in OpenSolaris snv_27 and higher.)

There is not much documentation at the moment.  Try 'job help', or see the
